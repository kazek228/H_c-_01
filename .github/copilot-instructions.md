This is a C# console application project using .NET. When working with this codebase:

- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes and methods, camelCase for variables)
- Use proper exception handling with try-catch blocks where appropriate
- Include XML documentation comments for public methods and classes
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Use async/await patterns for asynchronous operations when needed
- Leverage built-in .NET libraries and frameworks when possible
